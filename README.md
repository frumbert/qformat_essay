This is a moodle question import/exporter for essay questions.

Each line of the import text file has to have the question name, then a period and space or tab, then the question text.

Blank lines are skipped, as are lines that don't contain a period.

Essay questions are imported using the inbuilt html editor and are set to 15 lines.
